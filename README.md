🧠 How It Works
Multiple turtles of different colors line up at the start

You place your bet (type the color)

Each turtle moves forward at random speeds

First turtle to cross the finish line wins

The game checks if you bet correctly ✅❌

💻 Run it Locally
bash

python turtle_race.py
No external libraries required – just built-in turtle

🎮 Example Turtles
python
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
Each turtle is created in a loop, spaced vertically and positioned at the left edge.
